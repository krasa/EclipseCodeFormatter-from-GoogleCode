== Optimizing imports ==
 * set "Class count to use import with '`*`'" and "Name count to use static import with '`*`'" to 999 or more (Settings - Code Style - Imports)
 * delete or modify import layout as you wish, there is no need to define packages (Settings - Code Style - Imports)
 * IntelliJ's Import Optimizing must be turned off (Settings-Editor-Show "Reformat Code" dialog...)
 * IntelliJ will be still used for optimizing, this plugin just appends blank lines between the groups. 
 * Import groups can be joined together (blank line is not added), Example  of settings:   java-javax-cz-org-net-com; com-org;

== Getting the Eclipse code formatter preferences file ==

 # With your project open in Eclipse's workspace, right-click the project and choose Properties.
 # Go to Java Code Style | Formatter and select Enable project specific settings.
 # Also in the project properties, go to Java Compiler and select Enable project specific settings. *Make sure that the Compiler compliance level is set right.*
 # Click OK to save the settings.
 # Go to the .settings directory inside your project's directory. There you will find the org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs file which contains the Eclipse formatter settings.

===Eclipse formatter cannot format code for java 1.5+ by default. So it is important to check that following lines are in preference file:===
 * org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.compliance=1.6
 * org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.codegen.targetPlatform=1.6
 * org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.source=1.6

== Notifications ==
 * if you do not like them, turn them off (Settings - Notifications)
